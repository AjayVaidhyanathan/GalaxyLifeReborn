## GalaxyLifeReborn

**GalaxyLifeReborn** is a project that aim to revive the Galaxy Life android version (Galaxy Life: Pocket Adventures) from scratch. This is basically an attempt to reproduce the game server by reverse engineering the game client.

### Setup the server

The server requires some dependencies that can be installed with the following command:
> python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

### How can i start the server ?

To start the server you'll simply need to use the following commands:
> cd src && python app.py

## More info

I tried to detail the approach I followed to reverse engine [here](https://github.com/Galaxy1036/GalaxyLifeReborn/wiki), feel free to give it a look if you're interested
